Feature: Basic Flow from landing page
	In order to develop an automated test efficiently
	As a first approach to BDD
	I would like to navigate on the main page of Edgeunity checking some elements

Scenario:  Basic functionality on Edgeunity landing page
	Given an user that visit our landing page	
	When the user clicks on support button
	And Specflow+-Excel
	Then the support page is displayed successfully
